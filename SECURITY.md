# Tilled Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability or Security Issue

Tilled's security and engineering teams take security issues in our services and applications very seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contribution(s).

If you identify a security issue in any of our products, please send an email to the Tilled Security team at:

    security@tilled.com

In your email, please provide a detailed proof of concept (POC) and/or evidence clearly outlining the vulnerability and security impact of the issue. Please include the string "Tilled Application Vulnerability" in the subject line. If you are a security researcher and are a member of HackerOne (with a positive reputation and signal), feel free to include your H1 username or associated email address and we'll invite you to our private Bug Bounty program as well.  While our SDKs and example repositories are not explicitly in scope for monetary bounties, if we make any changes to our core, in-scope services based on your report, we may award a bounty.

_Note: A HackerOne account and report submission to our program is required to receive any bounty award. We will not award a bounty unless it is through that program and complies with our program policy and HackerOne's policies._

## Disclosure Process

After the Tilled security team receives your report, they will review and validate it internally if-possible. A member of that team will send a response to you outlining any next steps or further information needed and we'll keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and/or disclosure (if applicable). 

_NOTE: Please report security bugs in any third-party modules, libraries, and/or dependencies to the person, organization, or team that owns and/or supports those resources._

Thanks and Happy Hacking!
